# Seizure Detection using EEG Data

This repository focuses on the development of machine learning models to detect epileptic seizures using EEG data. The work encompasses data preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying various machine learning techniques, including ensemble learning, to achieve high accuracy in seizure classification.

## Key Features of the Repository

### 1. **Dataset Handling**
   - Scripts for loading and preprocessing EEG datasets, ensuring the data is clean and ready for analysis.
   - Functions to standardize and normalize EEG signals for consistency across samples.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extraction of critical features such as bandpower measures and statistical descriptors to capture meaningful patterns from EEG signals.
   - Feature selection techniques to optimize model performance and reduce dimensionality.

### 3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Implementation of supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
   - Exploration of **ensemble learning methods**, such as Bagging and Boosting, to combine the strengths of multiple models and improve detection accuracy.

### 4. **Evaluation and Visualization**
   - Tools to evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualizations to analyze data distributions, feature importance, and model predictions for better interpretability.

## Goals of the Project
This project aims to create robust seizure detection systems that can aid in real-time monitoring and healthcare applications, contributing to better management of epilepsy.
