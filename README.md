# Seizure Detection using EEG Data

This repository focuses on the development of machine-learning models to detect epileptic seizures using EEG data. The work involves preprocessing EEG signals, extracting features, and implementing machine learning algorithms for accurate seizure classification.

# Key Features of the Repository

 1. Dataset Handling
   - Provides scripts to load and preprocess EEG datasets.
   - Includes functions to clean and standardize EEG signals for consistency.

 2. Feature Engineering
   - Implements feature extraction techniques, such as band power measures and statistical descriptors, to capture meaningful patterns from EEG signals.
   - Features are tailored for distinguishing seizure and non-seizure events.

3. Machine Learning Models
Implementation of supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
Exploration of ensemble learning methods, such as Bagging and Boosting, to combine the strengths of multiple models and improve detection accuracy.

 4. Evaluation and Visualization
   - Scripts for evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Provides visualizations of data, features, and model performance for better interpretability.

 Goals of the Project
This project aims to create robust seizure detection models that can potentially aid in the development of real-time seizure monitoring systems, contributing to advancements in healthcare and epilepsy management.
